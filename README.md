> A simple project using create-react-app, coffeescript, and a custom version of react-hyperscript-helpers.

**NOTE:** This package is not on npm yet so the installation instructions will not work. If you want to use it you need to clone it and then either run `yarn global link` or `npm -g link` from inside the created directory. Then install yeoman and create-react-app globally as instructed below.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-coffee-react using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

This generator also depends on the create-react-app also available on npm

```bash
npm install -g yo create-react-app generator-coffee-react
```

or

```bash
yarn global add yo create-react-app generator-coffee-react
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo coffee-react
```

This will prompt you for a name for your app. You may also provide a name like this:

```bash
yo coffee-react my-app-name
```

Keep in mind this will be fed to create-react-app and will need to support it's naming conventions (no-caps, etc.).

* [coffeelint](coffeelint.org)

## Known Issues

* [ ] Currently only works with Yarn. I should be able to work this out shortly.
* [ ] You will be prompted to overwrite your `package.json` file. This is a limitation of Yeoman as there is no way to update the file once `create-react-app` creates it.

## Getting To Know Yeoman

* Yeoman has a heart of gold.
* Yeoman is a person with feelings and opinions, but is very easy to work with.
* Yeoman can be too opinionated at times but is easily convinced not to be.
* Feel free to [learn more about Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/).
